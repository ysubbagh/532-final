HARDWARE + CODE BASE CONFIGURATION

---HARDWARE---
- Required is a esp32 with a ultrasonic sensor connected 
    (not to connect to the 5v pin and not the 3.2v pin or measurment read will not be accurate)
- Device should be mounted to the top of the water tank and the sensor should be facing down towards the water/bottom of the drum.

---CODE BASE---
- The connect_aws.ino file does the brunt of the work but reiles on the secrets within the secrets.h file. 
    The secrets have been removed from the file (replaces by "xxx"). To connect to AWS and post to the supplied sub channel
    the user must input their internet SSID and password, from there the device will connect to the internet. Next, the user 
    needs to input their AWS IoT Core endpoint, CA, and certifiacte and key that was provided when the devices thing was created
    on AWS IoT Core Hub.  

- Code needs to be pushed onto the device. Once plugged into the permamnted power source, press the BOOT button to turn the 
    device on and begin uploading to AWS.
